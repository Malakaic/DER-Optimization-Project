remember to install tinker, geopy, gurobi, etc

working on getting curl set up to verify NREL API key, will respond with results soon
update: curl only works in the terminal, took a sec to figure that out lol

NREL API only works when parameters are shortened to lat and lon, in that order after the API key

To seperate the json format from NREL, must have annual_avg_dni = data['outputs']['avg_dni']['annual'], etc
